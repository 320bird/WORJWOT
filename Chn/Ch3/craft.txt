There was a time, before the Breaking, when men and women wielded the One Power side by side with no fear of any taint on saidin.

大崩溃前，曾有这样的时光，男人和女人们不必惧怕被污染的塞丁，携手挥舞着至上力。

In this time there were no wars—even the word for war was lost, known only to scholars—and all manner of wonders were commonplace.

那时没有战争，战争一词只有学者们听说过，现今被视为奇迹的事情在那时都只是寻常。

This age is now known as the Age of Legends.

如今这一时期被称为传说时代。

It has been well over three thousand years since the end of the Age of Legends, and its origins have been lost in the shroud of time.

距传说时代结束已有三千年，其真面目早已被时间掩埋。


The little that is known has been gleaned from a few fragmented records which must be puzzled together to form a partial understanding of the Age.

把搜集到的少量残卷拼合起来，才能对传奇时代有一些粗浅片面的了解。

=============================================================================

One thing is certain: it was a very long and prosperous period in the
history of the world.

可以确定的是，传奇时代是一段漫长和繁荣的历史。

Huge cities, such as Paaran Disen, M'Jhm, Comelle, Mar Ruois, and Adanza, arose to glitter as towering technological jewels among the lush greenery and verdant fields of crops which surrounded them.

帕阿兰迪森（Paaran Disen），马加姆（M'Jhm），卡莫尔里（Comelle），马尔儒奥伊斯（Mar Ruois），阿丹扎（Adanza）等大城市耸立于葱郁的绿树碧野之间，如人造宝石般闪烁着光芒。

The great research college of Collam Daan, located in V'saine, with its magnificent floating sphere, drew seekers of knowledge from all across the land to study and discover new wonders of science and the One Power.

坐落于维塞尼（V'saine）的考兰达恩（Collam Daan）大研究院，上空漂浮着巨大球体，吸引着整个大陆的求知者，前来学习和发现科学和至上力的新奇迹。


Sho-wings filled the air and jo-cars sped along the ground, leaving little trace of their passage as they carried people and cargo from city to city.

舒翼（Sho-wings）布满天空，轴车（ jo-cars）疾行大地，不留痕迹地在城市间运载着客人和货物。
Crime was almost unknown, rehabilitation quick and certain. It was a time of idyllic peace, with all the possibilities and wonders of the universe awaiting discovery.

稀有的犯罪行为，能够在很快被完全解决。这个时代如诗一般的平和，宇宙所有的可能性和奇迹正在等待人们去探索。

 

===========================================================================

 

The people of this age had long outgrown any interest in material wealth as a goal unto itself. Status and honor were all-important, and could only be gained through service to the community. All hoped to be allowed to serve according to their gifts and to be found worthy of that service.

在这样一个时代里，人们对单纯地积聚财富早已失去兴趣，他们看重的是通过社会服务而获得的地位和荣誉。所有人都期待自己能够在社会服务中发挥自己的天赋。

Several sources mention the fact that even names reflected a person's status and honor.

一些资料显示，那时名字也反映着一个人的地位荣誉。

Everyone was born with two names and could earn the third one only through accomplishment, apparently possible in many fields.

所有人出生时都有一名一姓，通过在各个领域的成就，可以再获得一个称号。

===========================================================

The people afforded the most status, though they still had to earn their third name through great individual works, were those whose gifts made them capable of the greatest service: those who could effectively channel the One Power.

 

地位最高的，是那些有能力充分引导至上力的人，他们具有最强大的服务社会能力。当然，这些人仍需要付出个人的努力才能获得称号。

These men and women were called Aes Sedai, which meant "servant of all" in the Old Tongue. They were dedicated to using the full extent of their gift for the betterment of their world.

在古语中这些男女被称作爱斯瑟戴，意为“公仆”。这些人致力于充分利用自己的天赋，改造世界。

Their symbol was a circle, half white and half black with the colors separated by a sinuous line,
representing the equal and opposing balance of the saidin and saidar that made up the halves of the True Source.

他们的象征标志，是一个被一条曲线隔成半黑半白的圆形，代表组成真源的塞丁和塞达间对抗平衡的关系。

 

====================================================================================

Since the ability to channel was a genetic recessive, only two to three percent of the population could channel.

因为引导能力来自隐性遗传，只有百分之二三的人口能够引导。

Most of them were fairly weak, but the few who had great strength could perform feats that now seem miraculous.

其中的大部分能力很弱。但那一小部分具有强大力量的人，能够作出现在被视为奇迹的壮举。

The talent was split equally among men and women, with men being stronger in general than women in the use of the Power, though individual strength did not matter greatly, as most Aes Sedai worked in teams.

 天赋在男女间平均分配，尽管男性使用至上力的能力一般更强一些，由于爱斯瑟戴合作工作，个人强大程度的差异就显得不太重要了。

=================================================================================================

Oddly, it appears from the fragmented records concerning Aes Sedai that many of them followed vocations which had little or nothing to do with the One Power or being Aes Sedai.

奇怪的是，一些关于爱斯瑟戴的残卷记载，他们中的很多人并没有从事和至上力或爱斯瑟戴有关的职业。

When it was necessary to form a circle to perform some task, these Aes Sedai could be summoned from their other
careers by the Hall of the Servants to assist with their particular strengths and skills.

必要时，公仆大会可以召唤他们暂离自己的职业，使用他们特别的能力和技术，构建回旋完成特定的工作。

===================================================================================================

Certain professions were primarily dominated by Aes Sedai.

 

某些行业被爱斯瑟戴主导。

All Healers were channelers, called Restorers, able to do far more healing with the One Power than medicine alone allowed.

所有的医师都是引导者，被称为恢复师，他们使用至上力进行治疗的效果，比单纯使用药剂好得多。

No herb remedy or surgery could match the Restorer for speed or efficiency.

恢复师治疗的速度和效率，远超草药和手术。

No disease or injury, save death, was beyond the capacity of the Power to heal. Death from causes other
than old age occurred only when the victim was beyond the reach of an Aes Sedai Restorer.、

除却死亡，没有至上力无法治愈的伤患。除了因为年老，只有在爱斯瑟戴恢复师无法及时赶到的情况下，患者才会死亡。

===============================================================================

 

Mining, as such, was done with Aes Sedai who were strong in Earth.

采矿一类的工作，由使用土的能力很强的爱斯瑟戴完成。
They could find and remove pure ores without any damage to the structure
or ecology of the land.

他们不需破坏地面的结构和生态，便可勘探并采集到精纯的矿石。

They could even use the Power to create alloys far beyond the strength of any constructed otherwise, though such alloys were rare and highly valued even then.

他们甚至可以制造出强度最大的合金，这些合金在当时也是很贵重的。

These alloys could be worked using conventional methods.

合金可以用于传统锻造。

================================================================

Farmland produced optimum yield through use of the One Power.

使用至上力可以使农田增产。

In a method called "seed singing," Ogier (a separate race of beings gifted with the ability to aid and enhance growing things), Nym, and Da'shain Aiel worked as a team, focusing the One Power to insure perfect growth for every field they "sang." 

巨灵（一个具有扶助万物生长天赋的种族），乃木和达善艾伊尔一起合作，使用一种叫做”播种吟唱“的方法，把至上力汇集到他们吟唱的田地中，使庄稼顺利生长。

Sung crops were immune to blight and impervious to insects.

接受吟唱的庄稼不会受到疫病和虫害的侵袭。

As a result, most crops reached their best possible growth and highest nutritional

content.

这样，大部分作物生长旺盛，营养丰富。

Aes Sedai also manipulated the weather to best advantage.

爱斯瑟戴还能制造适宜的气候，

Droughts, floods, and other natural disasters were apparently
unknown.

那时的人都没有见识过干旱洪水之类的天灾。

 

=========================================================

Most technological research and development was done by Aes Sedai.

大部分科技是爱斯瑟戴研究开发出来的。

Entire branches of science owed their existence to the use of the One Power.

许多科学分支都基于至上力的使用。
=================================================
One particularly interesting fragment records Aes Sedai participating in an avenue of research that led to the development of living constructs made with and/or able to utilize the One Power. 
一写残卷的记录尤为有趣： 一项有爱斯瑟戴参与的研究，最终开发出了新的生物，一些新生物还可以使用至上力。

Chora trees were one such construct. Their large green trefoil leaves emitted an aura of peace and well-being to any who passed beneath them.
乔拉（Chora）树就是其中的一种新生物。 走在树下的人们，总可以感受到巨大的的三瓣绿叶，散发的出祥和气氛。

===========================================================================

The Nym, another construct, were sentient beings with the ability to utilize the One Power for the benefit of plants and growing things. 
还有一种有智慧的生物叫乃木（Nym），他们具有使用至上力帮助植物生长的能力。
As a nameless scribe in Paaran Disen wrote, "Where a Nym touched, all manner of green and growing things thrived."
帕阿兰迪森城的一位无名文人曾写道：“乃木所及之处，万物茁壮生长。”
=======================================================
Other fields of Aes Sedai endeavor included design and construction of angreal, sa'angreal and ter'angreal. 
爱斯瑟戴的另一个竭力研究的领域是法器，圣法器，特法器的设计和制造。
Angreal and sa'angreal, as mentioned previously, enhanced the ability to channel. 
如前所述，法器和圣法器用于加强引导能力。
Ter'angreal, however, were tools made to perform a specific function. Some had to be activated and
energized with the One Power, and could only be used by Aes Sedai. Others could be used by anyone.
而特法器，是为特殊用途制造的器具。有些必须以至上力开启和激发，这些特法器只有爱斯瑟戴可以使用。另一些则可以被所有人使用。

==============================================================
Some of these artifacts have survived to this day, but the original purpose of many of them remains unknown. 
这些器具有一部分幸存到了今天，但当初制造他们的目的却已不为人知。
Research in this area has been limited by the dangerous nature of many ter'angreal. 
由于特法器的危险性，在这方面的研究非常有限。
Some channelers have been killed or burned out when attempting to work with these artifacts.
一些引导者在研究这些器具时，遭遇了死亡或者燃尽。



=============================================================================
Several of the more unusual surviving ter'angreal are doorways or arches. 
幸存的特法器中有一些很特别的门和拱门。
It is not known where, when, or how the person entering is transported, but while the visitor is within their influence everything has the texture of reality.
进入这些门的人被传送到何时何地，怎样被传送的都不得而知，只知道在其影响下，进入者感觉到的一切都像是真实的。
××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××
The tri-arched ter'angreal within the heart of the White Tower requires women who can channel to activate it, and aids in testing a novice hoping to be advanced to the rank of Accepted. 
白塔深处，有一座三拱的特法器，由女性引导来激活，用于学徒升级为见习生的测试。

The arches, each made of silver material and standing just tall enough to walk under, make the initiate face her worst fears, first for what was, second for what is, and third for what will be.
拱门为银质，高度仅容一人通过。 受试者三次进入拱门，将分别面对自己过去，现在和未来最大的恐惧。

A similar ter'angreal stands in the Aiel city of Rhuidean and is believed to show the Wise Women who use it their possible futures.
在艾伊尔的城市鲁迪安，有一座较小的特法器，据说可以为使用它智妇们显示她们未来的各种可能性。

No one has been able to determine whether the current usage of either is at all similar to its original
purpose.
这些特法器最初的用途是否如此，没人能说得清。
--------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps the strangest of all known ter'angreal are two tall redstone doorways, similar to yet different from each other in form and function, which do not require the user to be a channeler. 
最奇怪的特法器，大概要数两个红石制成的高大门廊。两个门廊的外形和功能都很相似又有所不同。不是引导者也可以使用它们。

Each stands independent of any supporting structure and is twisted strangely so that the eye keeps slipping away from the contour of its shape. 
两个门廊都不需要任何支撑，扭曲的形状之怪异，令人无法直视。
One of these, decorated with three sinuous lines that run from top to bottom on each upright, resides in the Stone of Tear. 
其中之一保存在提尔巨岩，两只立柱上各贯穿着三条扭曲的线条。
Anyone passing through it enters a strange world where he or she is allowed to ask three questions and receive truthful answers. 
穿过门廊的人，会进入一个奇异的世界，在那里可以询问三个问题，并得到可信的答案。
By an ancient compact with the inhabitants of the other side, no lamps, torches, items made of iron, or musical instruments are allowed within.
基于远古时代与那里居民的协议，进入那边的世界，不能携带灯或火炬，铁制品和乐器。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other doorway, found in Rhuidean, is also crafted of redstone with twisting corners, but is decorated with rows of inverted triangles running the length of each upright. As with its counterpart, no device
for making light, no iron, and no musical instruments may be brought within. Unlike its counterpart in Tear, what is granted within are three requests, but only at a price. The few who have ventured into it have discovered that the price can be very high.
另一个在鲁狄安被发现的门廊，扭曲的边框红石雕成的，立柱的装饰满一排排倒置的三角。和提尔的门廊一样，不能携带发光装置，铁器和乐器进入。和提尔门廊不同的是，进入门廊后可也满足三个请求，也需要付出代价。为数不多的贸然闯入者会发现这代价非常高昂。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost nothing is known of the worlds beyond the two doorways, except that the answers received are always true, though not always easily understood, and the requests are always granted, though not always as intended by the petitioner. Several ancient legends seem to refer to the inhabitants of the other side of these ter'angreal, and to indicate that dealing with them is both delicate and dangerous.
对两个门廊外的世界几乎一无所知，只知道答案一定是真实的，但未必容易理解，请求一定会被满足，但不一定符合请求者的意愿。一些古代传说似乎和这些特法器之外世界的居民有关，并指出和他们之间做交易，既不保险，又很危险。

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One property both arches and doorways seem to have in common is that they may only be used once by the same individual, which makes them unlike most other ter'angreal, which can be reused as
needed.
这些拱门和门廊有一个共同的特性，同一个人只能使用一次。而其它特法器，都可以被使用任意多次。

According to all sources, the Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends had a very loose sort of organization.
所有资料都显示，在传说时代，爱斯瑟戴的组织非常松散。

To what extent that organization was part of the world government is not known; clearly the Aes Sedai were highly influential, with considerable power, at least at times, but equally clearly they were not the entire government and did not necessarily dominate it.
爱斯瑟戴的组织在政府中占多大比重不得而知。显然爱斯瑟戴们有着很大的影响力有时还很有权力，但政府也不是完全由他们组成，并由他们主宰。

===========================================================================
They had their own internal governing structure through the Hall of the Servants, which was the core of the guild that controlled and regulated all those who could channel. 
爱斯瑟戴内部有自己的管理结构。组织的核心是公仆殿，所有能够引导的人都受其管辖。

This guild had branches in every city, town, and village that housed Aes Sedai. 
驻有爱斯瑟戴的每个城市，城镇和村庄都有分支组织。

In large cities the guild hall was usually an impressive building. 

In small towns or villages the guild often met in someone's home, temporarily dedicated for that purpose. 

The main Hall of the Servants, located in the capital city of Paaran Disen, was described in
one holographic fragment as having "massive columned entrances, large ornate doorways, and polished floors of glowing white elstone."


The Hall of the Servants regulated the Aes Sedai, setting and enforcing
the rules that pertained to channelers. Since Aes Sedai of this time often
worked in teams, detailed rules of conduct and procedure were essential to
the guild. All law and punishment for Aes Sedai were handled within the
guild. Little record survives to detail the actual bureaucracy, save that the
individual Aes Sedai who was elected to head it was usually styled as "First
Among Servants," and sat on the High Seat. There are records that, toward
the end of the Age, Lews Therin Telamon, who was then First Among
Servants, wore the ring of the Tamyrlin and summoned the Nine Rods of
Dominion. The description of the ring and exact nature of the nine rods
have been lost, but it seems clear that the Aes Sedai, through the Hall of
the Servants, wielded great power and were accorded a very high level of
prestige and respect.
Some historians, although
not all, believe that the Oath Rod
of the Aes Sedai may in fact be
one of the original Nine Rods of
Dominion mentioned in the
ancient texts. The Oath Rod is
currently held by the Aes Sedai of
the White Tower and is used by
each Accepted as she gives the
oaths that are part of the
ceremony of becoming an Aes
Sedai. A ter'angreal, the Oath
Rod is capable of binding a
promise "bone deep" into the one
who holds it, so that any oath
given cannot be broken unless the
swearer is stilled.
The "servants of all" were themselves
apparently served by the Da'shain Aiel.
These people were sworn to a covenant thatbound them to serve the Aes Sedai and
uphold the "Way of the Leaf," a pacifistic
code of honor. The exact details and history
of this covenant are lost, but we can surmise
that each Aiel was pledged in service to a
particular Aes Sedai, although it was not
unusual for an Aes Sedai to be served by
more than one Aiel. Their loyalty to the
covenant and their service earned the
Da'shain a level of respect second only to
that accorded to the Aes Sedai.
The Da'shain Aiel had a very specific
mode of dress that set them apart from
regular citizens. They wore their hair short
except for a tail in the back. They usually
dressed in plain coat, breeches, and soft
laced boots, usually in shades of brown or
gray. Sources are not clear concerning whether or not Da'shain Aiel could
channel, though they do agree that the Aiel could often enhance
channeling, as when adding their voices to the seed singing of the Ogier.
With so few people able to channel, the Power had to be used
selectively. Aes Sedai were not expected to maintain or energize machines,
for instance, but rather concentrated their efforts on designing and
creating the technology for them. Technicians and other skilled nonchannelers
could then handle the construction and repair; after that,
anyone could operate them. The process that enabled the great Sharom, or
floating sphere of Collam Daan, to hover high above the university was
discovered and refined through the use of the One Power, but the sphere
was built by normal people and suspended through use of the world's own
magnetic and gravitational fields.
One often-mentioned benefit of Power-based technology was a very
clean, aesthetically pleasing environment. Pollution from refining,
transport, and industry was unknown, since waste by-products could be
dispersed on a sub-molecular level. This waste-free technology, combined
with the culture's need for a harmonious environment wherever possible,
led to a lifestyle that focused on beauty and comfort as much as on
utilitarian efficiency.
This marriage of aesthetics and functionality was especially evident in
the major cities of the age, which were Paaran Disen, M'Jinn, Comelle,
Adanza, Mar Ruois, V'saine, Jalanda, Emar Dal, Paral, Halidar, Kemali,
Tsomo Nasalle, Devaille, and Tzora, in order of population size and
importance. Each of these major metropolitan areas was a work of art unto
itself.
V'saine, among the major cities, was best known as the home of the
Collam Daan. The great university's silver and blue domes were bested only
by the Sharom, a huge white sphere a thousand feet in diameter that
floated serenely above it. Together, the Collam Daan and the Sharom were
the world's foremost center for research and development.
The Sharom was one of the classic examples of functional beauty. It
might seem impractical to suspend a building high in the air, especially a
scientific research facility that required its visitors to use an airborne
transport or the One Power, but the designers of Collam Daan did it simply
because they could, and because the Sharom was a sky-borne pearl that
celebrated the triumph of their art.
The coastal city of Comelle, third-largest in the world, overlooked the
sea with breathtaking splendor from its mountainside. Its immense glass,
crystal, and metal structures clung to the steep rock like a shining flower
bursting from the stone. Adanza was reported to "thrive with a vitality in its
beauty matched only by the vitality of its people." Even Tzora, the smallest
of the major cities, was known for its multihued glass towers, in a wide
variety of geometric shapes, which glittered like jewels in the sun.
Paaran Disen, central seat of government and crown jewel of them all,
not only contained wonders of architectural genius among its spires and
towers, but also the Hall of the Servants with its columns and shimmering
elstone.
In each city, whether large or small, select use of the One Power allowed
such latitude in architectural design and construction that almost every
artistic whim could be indulged. Variations on geometric and organic
shapes were favored, with gardens, trees, and fountains freely interwoven
into the urban fabric. Silvery towers that stretched so high they seemed to
touch the sky were often interspersed with domes and arches that glowed
rainbow bright with inset colored glass. Ribbonlike monorails and
walkways hung suspended in the air between the structures, as if in an
attempt to lace them together.
In every city, tall trefoil-leafed chora trees lined the smooth pavements
of the streets and walkways, giving both shade and their unique aura of
contentment. It was a saying of the Age that a city without chora trees
would seem bleak as a wilderness. Gardens that may have contained redand
white-blossomed calma flowers and night-blooming dara lilies
surrounded many of the structures.
Over the centuries, the chora
tree has become better known
through legend than through
experience, for very few of these
constructs survived the Breaking
or its aftermath. Also known by
the Aiel name Avendesora, the
tree is now extremely rare and
highly prized. Only one chora
tree, called Avendoraldera, has
been known to exist outside the
Aiel Waste since the time of the
Breaking. Avendoraldera no
longer exists, having been
destroyed by King Laman of
Cairhien. The tree's destruction
heralded the Aiel War and
eventually led to Laman's death.
Perhaps because of the pleasant nature
of the environment, most people preferred
to walk from one place to another except
when distances were too great or burdens
too large. Or when, as in the case with the
Sharom, the entrances were high above the
ground and required special transport. For
these occasions, the people used a wide
variety of vehicles.
Most short-range mass transport was
handled by large multi-passenger vehicles
that used a type of antigravity technology.
Jo-cars, jumpers, and hoverflies had a much
smaller passenger and cargo capacity. Jocars
had a very efficient four-wheel design,
or, in the floater version, a type of
gravitational hovercraft technology. Both
jumpers and hoverflies could float
suspended above the ground at various
distances. The smoothly paved roads made
all types of travel, both vehicular and
pedestrian, more efficient.
Long-range transport relied primarily on the sho-wing, an airborne
vehicle available in several types and sizes. The sho-wing was capable of
both short- and long-range flight, sometimes at high rates of speed. All
overseas travel was done via sho-wing. The sho-wing designs were derived
from a basic delta-wing pattern, which was varied to suit the specific needs
of each individual purpose. Some of them were very large, capable of
carrying hundreds of passengers, and some were quite small, for personal
use.
For the Aes Sedai, and sometimes those who served them, mechanical
transport was unnecessary. Many people who could channel effectively
could also Travel, a process which used the One Power to open a doorway
that allowed stepping from one location to another at any distance without
crossing the intervening space. Anyone could pass through the opening if it
was made large enough, but only an Aes Sedai could actually create and
hold the doorway. It was a very convenient way to move between locations,
but impractical for use by the general public. Skimming, a process similar
to Traveling, was occasionally used by those less adept. This method
involved the use of platforms or steps in the void outside the Pattern to
carry the traveler from one point to another.
Traveling," or using the One
Power to move from place to
place, has only recently been
rediscovered. Like most things
having to do with the Power, it is
different for men and women. A
man must use the Power to bore a
hole through the Pattern from his
location to the place he wants to
be. A woman, however, creates a

even transporting to other worlds, both
among the stars and in other dimensions.
Portal Stones, activated by the One Power,
allowed the users and any who accompanied
them to travel to other dimensions and
worlds within the universe of the Wheel. It
is doubtful that Portal Stones were used
regularly by any other than Aes Sedai,
because skill and strength in the Power were
needed to activate them.

location to where she wants to be.
When both places have achieved
enough of a similarity at one spot,
the places become one and she
can simply step through the
resulting opening. For either men
or women, attempting the
method of the other gender often
has tragic results.
Ruins of Portal Stones have
been discovered in various parts
of the world. Gray stone cylinders
approximately three spans tall
and a full pace thick, these stones
are covered with hundreds of
deeply incised diagrams and
markings. The Portal Stones are
said to be gateways to alternative
realities within the Pattern. The
knowledge of their use has been
lost, but it is believed that Aes
Sedai in the Age of Legends used
them freely. Indications are that
they may predate the Age of
Legends.
If the bits
of
information
concerning
daily life that
have been
preserved
over the
centuries can
be believed,
even ordinary
people had
access to a wide variety of technological
wonders that seemed to rival the Power
itself. It was possible to "live" stories in your
own home by some means no longer known,
and entertainment also was brought directly
into the home through a three-dimensional
imaging process. Live or prerecorded
programs took on lifelike form right before the viewer. Communications
also made use of this process. It was possible, with a code, to contact
anyone who had access to a call unit, and to then see that person, or their
logo if they wished to preserve privacy, as a small three-dimensional
projection. This process created the illusion of being able to talk face-toface
no matter the actual distance involved.
Heat exchangers maintained interior environments at a constant
temperature regardless of the weather. Glowbulbs provided light without
need of recharging or replacement. Energy to propel vehicles and operate
devices was dispersed through a broadcast process that made it available to
anyone with the proper receiving equipment. Preservation of artifacts or
extreme perishables was possible with stasis-boxes. Time did not pass for
objects within a stasis-box once the box was activated.
While many fabrics primarily contained natural fibers, some fabrics like
streith and fancloth were entirely artificial. Streith was a shimmering
material, usually white, that changed color and opacity to match the mood
of the wearer. Fancloth created a camouflage effect, able to duplicate its
surroundings so faithfully as to make the wearer seem invisible. Both were
used in high-fashion garments. These fabrics exist today, but are quite rare,
and fancloth, at least, is used for far more practical applications.
Fancloaks, made of fancloth,
are one of the finest examples of
modern practicality deriving from
ancient fashion. Designed to
cover the wearer from head to
foot, these cloaks create an
almost perfect camouflage.
Because of the difficulty in
obtaining fancloth today, it is
exclusively reserved for use by
the Warders of the Aes Sedai. It is
believed to be manufactured in
One badly fragmented text believed to
date from this time contains some
interesting data regarding health and
healing. Because of the use of the Power in
health care, most people did not have to fear
dying from disease or injury. The average life
expectancy was between one hundred and
fifty and two hundred years. For Aes Sedai it
was considerably longer, since use of the
One Power somehow enhanced the youth
and durability of the channeler's body,
greatly extending his or her life. There are
records of some Aes Sedai being considered
barely middle-aged at three hundred years,
the White Tower by use of a
ter'angreal.
and some channelers may have lived seven
hundred years or more. Since long life spans
and excellent health care resulted in large
viable populations, it is fortunate that birthcontrol
methods were extremely reliable and without side effects.
This society was supported by a stable worldwide economy; it is
doubtful that the people of the Age would have been able to reach such a
high level of advancement without it. The global capitalistic economy gave
the greatest rewards for the greatest service, and while Aes Sedai handled
many important roles, they represented such a small percentage of the
community that the majority of jobs was left open to non-channelers.
Financial gain was not difficult to achieve, but meant little in a world
where most material things were plentiful. Individuals gained financial
reward based on their work and its value to society. Even a person in the
least-valued position gained enough money to assure a comfortable
standard of living. There was no poverty. Everyone who wished had a place
to serve.
Despite the overall harmonious balance within society, crime, including
violent crimes and crimes of passion, was not unknown. Society did not
believe in any type of restraint unless absolutely necessary. When the
perpetrators of violent acts were caught, they were not sent to prison.
Rather, they were constrained, in some manner not fully understood,
against repeat offenses. This binding made it impossible for the criminal
ever to repeat his crime. As a result, criminal acts of any kind were very
rare.
The Age's system of government was both strong and responsive.
Unfortunately very few details of this government or how it interacted with
the population at large and the Aes Sedai are available. The sparse
fragmented documents that have been preserved mention a worldwide
parliament, or "council," of democratically elected officials. They also
mention that within the government the ability to channel earned respect,
but did not guarantee prominence. From this we can deduce that Aes Sedai
were often elected to the council, and were influential, but were not
necessarily in charge.
It is easy to understand why major conflicts among people or classes
did not exist in the Age of Legends. Most of the motives for conflict had
been eliminated: Worldwide economic stability had been established,
removing any possibility of poverty or extreme financial inequality. Food
harvesting and distribution was enhanced by the high level of technology
and the use of the One Power, eliminating starvation and even deprivation.
Status was more important than financial gain, eliminating most types of
base greed, if not envy. In addition, the most powerful group of people, the
Aes Sedai, were seldom tempted to use their abilities for personal gain
alone, because they knew that service to others would reap greater rewards
and higher status than any political or financial manipulation ever could.
Without economic or survival motivations, conflicts rarely escalated
beyond argument, usually solved through mediation. As a result, the
concept of war did not exist. At least not until the very end of the Age.
